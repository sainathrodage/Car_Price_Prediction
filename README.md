# Car_Price_Prediction

The Purpose of this project  is to predict the price of the used cars by using Machine Learning Algorithms. A Car Price Prediction has been a high-interest research area, as it requires noticeable effort and knowledge of the field experts. We implemented and evaluated various machine learning models on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of different cars and their specifications. This Project helps the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.
